CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
IcedCoffeeScript is a superset of CoffeeScript that adds two new
keywords: `await` and `defer`.

IcedCoffeeScript is based on CoffeeScript V1 - the one without Javascript ES6
support. Based on top of last CoffeeScript V1, version 1.12.8, git commit id:
`943579a23943ce62e8d2e3dbc868f22bac773f36`.

## Iced v3 Alpha

We're current alpha-testing Iced v3, which emits ES6 with `yield`s and generators.
Relative to Iced v2, this version stays much closer to the CoffeeScript main body of
code, and emits much simpler code. The downside is that the target must run ES6, or
be transpiled into ES5 with a further step not handled by this package.

## How to Build

```
./bin/cake build
```

## Installation

If you have the node package manager, npm, installed:

```shell
npm install -g iced-coffee-script-3
```

Leave off the `-g` if you don't wish to install globally. If you don't wish to use npm:

```shell
git clone -b iced3 https://github.com/maxtaco/coffeescript.git
sudo coffeescript/bin/cake install
```

## Getting Started

Run REPL:

```shell
iced3
```

Execute a script:

```shell
iced3 /path/to/script.iced
```

Compile a script:

```shell
iced3 -c /path/to/script.iced
```
